          This project is a monolithic web application built with Flask and Bootstrap, designed to deliver a
          complete, end-to-end user experience within a single, cohesive system. The frontend, backend, business
          logic, and data layer are fully integrated to ensure consistency, reliability, and maintainability.

          It is one of my early full-stack projects, created to strengthen my practical understanding of Flask
          and to gain hands-on experience designing and implementing RESTful web services in a real-world context.

          The application features secure user authentication powered by Flask-Login and dynamic form handling
          through Flask-WTF. Data is stored using SQLite (PostgreSQL when hosted for your use), supporting user accounts, blog posts, and user comments,
          while passwords are protected using industry-standard hashing provided by Werkzeug to ensure a strong
          security baseline.
